Spring 2021 Software Engineering Term Project

App Developer

As a team, we developed an online store, consisting of a website and a mobile application, which interact over the web to an application web-server. We advanced our application by adding a stock management system, and by order processing that enabled users to see the status of their product as processing, in-transit, and delivered.
